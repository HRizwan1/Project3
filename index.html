	<h3>Lebron James</h3>
	<p> LeBron Raymone James (born December 30, 1984) is an American basketball player with the Cleveland Cavaliers. James first 
		garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country. With his unique combination of 
		size, athleticism and court vision, he became one of the premier players in the NBA. After leading the Miami Heat to 
		titles in 2012 and 2013, he returned to Cleveland and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016.

	<h3>Ford Mustang</h3>
	<p> The Ford Mustang is an American car manufactured by Ford. It was originally based on the platform of the second generation 
		North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 
		1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first 
		production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and 
		rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth 
		Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a "1964½" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch 
		since the Model A. The Mustang has undergone several transformations to its current sixth generation. The Mustang 
		created the "pony car" class of American muscle cars, affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks, 
		and gave rise to competitors such as the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin, Chrysler's revamped Plymouth 
		Barracuda, and the second generation Dodge Challenger. The Mustang is also credited for inspiring the designs of coupés 
		such as the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri, which were imported to the United States.
